Coderbyte challenges  
ArrayMatching  
Easy  
Description: For this challenge you will add elements from two arrays in a particular order.  
```
Have the function ArrayMatching(strArr) read the array of strings stored in strArr which will contain only two elements, both of which will represent an array of positive integers. For example: if strArr is ["[1, 2, 5, 6]", "[5, 2, 8, 11]"], then both elements in the input represent two integer arrays, and your goal for this challenge is to add the elements in corresponding locations from both arrays. For the example input, your program should do the following additions: [(1 + 5), (2 + 2), (5 + 8), (6 + 11)] which then equals [6, 4, 13, 17]. Your program should finally return this resulting array in a string format with each element separated by a hyphen: 6-4-13-17.

If the two arrays do not have the same amount of elements, then simply append the remaining elements onto the new array (example shown below). Both arrays will be in the format: [e1, e2, e3, ...] where at least one element will exist in each array.
Examples
Input: new String[] {"[5, 2, 3]", "[2, 2, 3, 10, 6]"}
Output: 7-4-6-10-6
Input: new String[] {"[1, 2, 1]", "[2, 1, 5, 2]"}
Output: 3-3-6-2
```

BinaryReversal  
Easy  
Description: For this challenge you will be reversing a binary string.    

LRU Cache  
Medium  
Description: For this challenge you will determine the order of elements within a simulated cache.  
```
Have the function LRUCache(strArr) take the array of characters stored in strArr, which will contain characters ranging from A to Z in some arbitrary order, and determine what elements still remain in a virtual cache that can hold up to 5 elements with an LRU cache algorithm implemented. For example: if strArr is ["A", "B", "C", "D", "A", "E", "D", "Z"], then the following steps are taken:

(1) A does not exist in the cache, so access it and store it in the cache.
(2) B does not exist in the cache, so access it and store it in the cache as well. So far the cache contains: ["A", "B"].
(3) Same goes for C, so the cache is now: ["A", "B", "C"].
(4) Same goes for D, so the cache is now: ["A", "B", "C", "D"].
(5) Now A is accessed again, but it exists in the cache already so it is brought to the front: ["B", "C", "D", "A"].
(6) E does not exist in the cache, so access it and store it in the cache: ["B", "C", "D", "A", "E"].
(7) D is accessed again so it is brought to the front: ["B", "C", "A", "E", "D"].
(8) Z does not exist in the cache so add it to the front and remove the least recently used element: ["C", "A", "E", "D", "Z"].

Now the caching steps have been completed and your program should return the order of the cache with the elements joined into a string, separated by a hyphen. Therefore, for the example above your program should return C-A-E-D-Z.
Examples
Input: new String[] {"A", "B", "A", "C", "A", "B"}
Output: C-A-B
Input: new String[] {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "D", "Q", "Z", "C"}
Output: E-D-Q-Z-C
```
